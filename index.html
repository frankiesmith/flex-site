	<p>Marty, such a nice name. (Main Street) Damn, where is that kid. Damn. Damn damn. (Marty shows up.) You're late, do you have no concept of time? Hey c'mon, I had to change, you think I'm going back in that zoot suit? The old man really came through it worked. What?</p>

  <div class="box">
	  <p>(Marty is trying to get Doc to drink the coffee, but it's not working.) You want to sober him up in a hurry, son, you're gonna have to use something a lot stronger than coffee. Yeah, what do you suggest? (smiles) Joey. Let's make some wake up juice. (They pull out several ingredients. The Bartender pours a little of everything into a glass.)</p>

	<p>(George takes the bottle of Coke and opens it for Marty. They begin walking over to the Café.) Last night, Darth Vader came down from planet Vulcan. And he told me that if I didn't take Lorraine, that he'd melt my brain. Yeah, well uh, lets keep this brain melting stuff to ourselves, okay? Oh, yeah, yeah. Alright, okay. Alright, there she is, George. Just go in there and invite her.</p>
</div>
  <div class="box">
	  <p>5... What? What if I don't go out there? You're a coward! 6... And you'll be branded a coward for the rest of your days!(to Marty) You! (Marty punches him again - he falls unconscious. Marty takes the Almanac out of Biff's jacket.) He's fine. (He runs off.) Hey, did you just take his wallet? He just took that guy's wallet! (Lyon Estates)</p>

  <div class="box">
	  <p>Yeah, something huh? Who would have thought? 100 to 1 shot. I wish I could go back to the beginning of the season and put some money on the Cubs. No, I just meant Miami.....what did you just say? I said I wish I could go back to the beginning of the season, put some money on the Cubbies! (Terry walks off. Marty has an idea.) (Blast from the Past) (The saleswoman takes the almanac from the window and gives it to Marty.)</p>

	  <p>Alright Doc, what's going on, huh? Where are we? When are we? (Doc lifts up his glasses and looks at the time display.) We are descending towards Hill Valley, California, at 4.29pm, on Wednesday, October 21st, 2015. 2015? You mean we're in the future?</p>
